# Sales Management Analysis Portfolio

This project showcases my proficiency in leveraging **Power BI** and **SQL** for insightful sales management analysis. By utilizing data from the **AdventureWorks Database** (a Microsoft sample OLTP database), I focused on extracting meaningful insights to empower strategic decision-making for sales teams.

## üîç Project Overview
The primary objective was to analyze sales data to identify:
- Sales budget trends and fluctuations.
- Customer-specific sales patterns.
- Product-specific sales insights.

This portfolio demonstrates how I integrated **SQL Server** for data cleaning and transformation with **Power BI** to create dynamic dashboards, delivering actionable insights for stakeholders.

## üíº Business Request & User Stories
### Business Request
Create an executive sales report for sales managers to monitor sales performance, track top-performing customers and products, and compare sales against budgets.

### User Stories

| 4  | Sales Manager       | Dashboard to monitor sales over time vs budget  | Compare actual sales against budgets    | Power BI dashboard with graphs and KPIs      |

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Transformation (SQL)
To create the data model, the following tables were extracted and transformed using SQL:
- **DIM_Calendar**
- **DIM_Customers**
- **DIM_Products**
- **FACT_InternetSales**

Additionally, sales budget data in Excel format was connected to the Power BI data model to enable comprehensive analysis.

## üìä Data Model
The data model integrated **FACT_Budget** with **FACT_InternetSales** and the dimension tables (**DIM_Calendar**, **DIM_Customers**, **DIM_Products**). This structure supported dynamic reporting and visualizations in Power BI.

## üìà Sales Management Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard consists of:
1. **Main Overview Page:** Summarizes key sales KPIs and trends.
2. **Customer Analysis Page:** Provides insights into customer-specific sales patterns.
3. **Product Analysis Page:** Highlights product performance and trends.

### Features
- Interactive graphs and filters.
- KPIs comparing sales performance against budgets.
- Drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **SQL Server**: Data cleaning and transformation.
- **Excel**: Supplementary data source for sales budgets.

## üåü Key Insights
